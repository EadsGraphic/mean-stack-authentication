# Project Title

Interested in learning the MEAN.io stack at a deeper level and want to further explore this technology stack. The ultimate goal is to learn enough over the next several months to develop a working production grade web application that will generate a revenue stream as a proof of concept idea. Once the necessary skills are required, I want to deploy this application that solves a true problem in the world and hopefully make the next great application on a digital cloud provider for the world to consume. Along the way I hope to not only improve my MEAN.io skills, but I want to focus on overall UI/UX design as well to truly create an user rich experience.
