# EadsGraphic Authentication Demo Web App

Interested in learning the MEAN.io stack at a deeper level and want to further explore this technology. The ultimate goal is to learn enough over the next several months to develop a working production-grade web application that will generate a revenue stream as a proof of concept idea. Once the necessary skills are acquired, I want to deploy this application on a digital cloud provider for the world to consume. Along the way, I hope to not only improve my MEAN.io skills, but I want to focus on overall UI/UX design as well to truly create a user rich experience.

### Prerequisites

> Node.JS
> Angular 6
> Mongo DB
